# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run

  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events for ALL branches
  push:
  pull_request:

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Runs a series of commands to build and test the project
      - name: Build and Test Project
        run: |
          # Replace these commands with the appropriate build and test commands for your project
          # For example, for a Node.js project:
          # npm install
          # npm test

          # For a Python project:
          # pip install -r requirements.txt
          # pytest
          
          # For a C++ project using CMake:
          # mkdir build
          # cd build
          # cmake ..
          # make
          # ctest --output-on-failure
